The term of this Agreement is three (3) years (“Initial Term”). The Initial Term will automatically renew for successive one-year terms (each a “Renewal Term”, and collectively with the Initial Term, the “Term”). A Member may terminate membership by providing written notice to LF no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.

LF reserves the right to refuse your Participation Agreement if you have outstanding obligations to the LF or any other LF projects. In no event will fees be refunded, upon a Member’s resignation or otherwise.

Notice of any increase in Fees will be provided in writing on or before October 15 of the then current calendar year and will apply at the next annual renewal. Fees for the Initial Term will not increase.
